I made this site to accomplish two goals: 
1. to showcase my skills and accomplishments,  but more importantly,
2. to learn [React](https://react.dev) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com). 

My professional frontend experience up to the point of writing this post had been 
in [Angular](https://angular.io), a TypeScript-based JavaScript framework used to develop dynamic web applications, and maintained
by the Google community.

There is the age old question: which is better for frontend development, *Angular vs. React*? 
Since I was using Angular on a daily basis at my place of work, I set out to answer this question during my personal time. React
differs from Angular in a few important ways. The most important is that React is a JavaScript-based *library*, not a *framework*,
used to build interactive UI components, and maintained by the Meta community. 

Add a few libraries to React and you can have a complete frontend framework, which is where *Gatsby* comes in. Gatsby is a React-based
framework that enables developers to build fast, secure, and powerful websites. With its innovative data layer, [GraphQL](https://graphql.org), 
integrating different content, APIs, and services into one web experience is incredibly simple.

After experimenting with React and Angular, asking the question "Which one is better?", really can only be answered "It depends".
React was simple to learn and the learning curve was much steeper for Angular than it was for React. React is certainly more popular
than Angular if you look at the number of developers using one over the other. If you want to build a complex enterprise application
that needs dependency injection, two-way data-binding, and high performance, your answer of which is better is probably Angular.
If you want high performance, modern and large web applications that depend on state-based UI, and one-way data-binding, then React is 
where you want to look.

Like any technology in Software Engineering, there are disadvantages and advantages of one over the other, and part of the job is
weighing the pros and cons to make the most informed decision on specific use cases. In this particular use case, I was looking for 
a way to manage content (a portfolio site with a blog) and provide a fast and reliable user experience to anyone who happened to
visit. Gatsby fits this mold perfectly as a React-based framework that allows for Content Management Service plugins. In addition, since 
Gatsby is a static-site generator, I could rely on my site to be blazing fast and SEO friendly. Overall, it was a pleasure to learn React via
Gatsby. I had a ton of fun learning a new JavaScript library (React) and a new framework in Gatsby. The **Why** of building my portfolio
site was simple, to promote myself. The **How** of building my site was a great way to explore new technologies and add to my toolbox of
Software Engineering tools. I recommend Gatsby to anyone trying to develop a fast and reliable site!
